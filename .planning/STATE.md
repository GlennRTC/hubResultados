### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack is locked: Next.js 15, Supabase, Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui, @react-pdf/renderer, Meta Cloud API, Vercel
- No patient accounts/passwords — ID + DOB auth via verification_code (stateless, zero friction)
- Multi-tenancy enforced at DB level via Supabase RLS (not application layer)
- Meta Cloud API direct (not Twilio) for WhatsApp — cost ~$0.0002/msg in Colombia
- Spanish-only UI — no i18n framework needed
